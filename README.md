# ThinkAboutIt
A place for Random ideas, example coding examples and answers, and other miscellaneous stuff

This is going to be the initial Repositorty for exploratory testing, coding, and marketing or company ideas for Shawn C Blick.
Although there are other repositories here, this will serve as the launching repository to track any GitHub wide changes made to this account.

Instead of providing a hello world example as is customary, I'm going to try and incorporate real world problems and coding examples for people to have fun with, but also so that they might use this a a learning example. 


This repository intends to incorporate some Open Source projects as well as other areas of interest such as mathematics, coding, Quality Assurance trends, software engineering of course, etc, etc.



This file was produced on October 22, 2017 as a GitHub sample project for Shawn C Blick.
